# Multiple Consumers

Promises may only be awaited once, and if they are not awaited, they must be returned or forgotten (see [Forget](the-basics.md#forget)).
You may wish to cache the result of the promise so that multiple consumers can retrieve the same result. You can do so via the `promise.GetRetainer()` API, which returns a `Promise.Retainer` or `Promise<T>.Retainer`. You can await the retainer multiple times until it is disposed. You can `await` it directly in async functions, or you can call `retainer.WaitAsync()` to get a promise that adopts the state of the retained promise. Dispose the retainer when you are finished with it.
