# Change Log

## v2.0.1 - April 7, 2022

Fixes:

- Fixed a memory leak with All/Merge/Race/First promises when object pooling is enabled.
- Fixed state check in `PromiseYieldInstruction` when the promise is already complete.

Optimizations:

- Less pooled memory when `T` of `Promise<T>` is a reference type and used by more than 1 types (example: `Promise<string>` and `Promise<object>`).
- More efficient execution in the common case.
