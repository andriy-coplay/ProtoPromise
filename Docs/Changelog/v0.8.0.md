# Change Log

## v0.8 - February 3, 2020

- Added method overloads to capture a value to pass into the delegate (see <a href="https://github.com/timcassell/ProtoPromise/blob/master/README.md#capture-values">README</a>).
- Removed `ThenDefer`, `CatchDefer`, and `CompleteDefer` (alternatively, you can `return Promise.New(deferred => {...});`).
- Removed Catches that accept a <T> without a value.
- Disable object pooling in debug mode.
- Remove `Reject()` without a value.
- Added `Then` overloads to allow returning a value/void in onresolved and a promise in onrejected, or vice-versa.
- Removed "NonAlloc" from static multi promise functions (except one to provide an IList to Promise.All).
- Fixed a retain bug with canceling the promise from a deferred.
- Added `Promise.Config.UncaughtRejectionHandler` to allow intercepting uncaught rejections before they are thrown.
