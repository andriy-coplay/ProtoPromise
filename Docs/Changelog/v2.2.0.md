# Change Log

## v2.2.0 - August 6, 2022

Enhancements:

- Added `Promise(<T>).AwaitWithProgress(maxProgress)` API to use current progress instead of passing in minProgress.
- Added `Promise(<T>).{RaceWithIndex, FirstWithIndex}` APIs to be able to tell which promise won the race.
- Added `Promise(<T>).WaitAsync(CancelationToken)` APIs, and added optional `CancelationToken` arguments to existing `WaitAsync` APIs.
- Added optional `bool forceAsync` arguments to existing `WaitAsync` and other APIs that allow changing context.

Fixes:

- Fixed `CancelationToken` callbacks not being invoked after they are registered after the original `System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource` has been reset (.Net 6.0+).
- Fixed a deadlock in `PromiseSynchronizationContext.Send` if the callback throws an exception. The exception is rethrown in .Net 4.5+.
- Fixed `WaitAsync` and `Progress` if null `SynchronizationContext` is passed in.
- Fixed compile errors in Unity 5.

Optimizations:

- Slightly increased performance and decreased memory (at the cost of no longer unwinding the stack, which users can now do with the `forceAsync` flag).

Misc:

- Completely removed internal stacktraces in .Net 6 or later.
- Added net6.0 build target.
