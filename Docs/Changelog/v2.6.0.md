# Change Log

## v2.6.0 - October 2, 2023

Enhancements:

- Added `Promise.AllSettled` and `Promise.MergeSettled` APIs.
- Added message between causality stack traces (matches behavior of `ExceptionDispatchInfo`).

Fixes:

- Fixed a `NullReferenceException` when `PromiseYielder` is used after `OnApplicationQuit`.
- Fixed a race condition with progress.
- Fixed a race condition with cancelations (was not an issue in RELEASE mode).
- Fixed causality trace not being preserved when a progress callback is invoked synchronously from an already resolved promise.

Optimizations:

- Fixed PromiseMethodBuilders allocating in tier0 jit.
- Object pool uses pointers for clear event instead of delegates in C# 9.
- Use `Interlocked` instead of lock for faster `Promise.ParallelFor`.
- Optimized `PromiseSynchronizationContext.Post`.
- Other small miscellaneous performance improvements.

Deprecated:

- Deprecated `ResultContainer.Result`, renamed to `ResultContainer.Value`.
- Deprecated `ResultContainer.RejectReason`, renamed to `ResultContainer.Reason`.
