# Change Log

## v2.0.2 - April 25, 2022

Fixes:

- Fixed `Promise.AwaitWithProgress` not working in IL2CPP.
- Fixed a rare race condition where a canceled promise could cause an invalid cast exception.

Optimizations:

- Fixed boxing nullable value-types.
- Reduced size of cancelable promises.
- Subscribing to progress now runs in O(1) time and consumes O(1) memory, down from O(n) for both.

Misc:

- Increased precision of progress, from 1/(2^13) to 1/(2^16).
