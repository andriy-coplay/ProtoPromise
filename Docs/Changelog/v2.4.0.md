# Change Log

## v2.4.0 - December 23, 2022

Enhancements:

- Added `Promise.ParallelFor` and `Promise.ParallelForEach` APIs to run iterations concurrently and asynchronously (compare to `Parallel.ForEach`).
- Exposed `CancelationRegistration.DisposeAsync()` in all supported runtimes.
- Added `AsyncLock` and `AsyncMonitor` to be able to lock around asynchronous resources (in the `Proto.Promises.Threading` namespace).

Fixes:

- Promise result values are no longer stored past the promise's lifetime.
- Fixed compilation errors in Unity 2017 when the experimental .Net 4.6 runtime is selected.
- Fixed compilation warnings in Unity when importing the ProtoPromise package through the Package Manager.
- Fixed default foreground context never being executed in Unity 2019.1 or newer.

Optimizations:

- Increased performance of progress reports.
- Increased performance of promises.
- Reduced memory consumption of `All`, `Merge`, `Race`, and `First` promises.

Misc:

- Progress reports now use full 32-bit float precision instead of 16-bit fixed precision.
- Changed `Promise.Run` `forceAsync` flag to default to `true` instead of `false`.

Breaking Changes:

- Changed `CancelationRegistration.DisposeAsync()` to return `Promise` instead of `ValueTask` (`await using` code still works the same, but may need a recompile).
